# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI-Java
Project done on Hyperskill
It has three difficulty levels: easy, medium and hard. 
To play, type "start player1 player2". Each player can be user or a difficulty level. 
The first player plays first and uses X, the second one uses O.
Type in coordinates as in a xy plane, ranging from 1 to 3.

The easy difficulty level makes random moves. 
The medium difficulty level tries to win when it can in the next move, or blocks the user when he/she would win in the next move. 
The hard difficulty level makes use of minimax to guess the best outcome from all possible moves.
